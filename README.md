Hi, I'm Vikram! ðŸ‘‹

Software Engineer and Flatiron School graduate with experience in Ruby on Rails, Javascript, and React.
I studied Neuroscience and Philosophy in college and have always been curious about the workings and potentiality of the mind. After college, I discovered a passion for using logic, problem solving skills, and creativity to make interesting and useful applications in the software world. 
I'm looking for an entry level software development position with training and mentorship opportunities to launch my career and catapault my skills to the next level. 
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on honing my interview skills and planning out my job search.

Aside from coding, I have a passion for fitness and lift weights religiously as well as consistently practicing the martial art, Muay Thai.
